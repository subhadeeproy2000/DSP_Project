# DSP_Project
It provides an introduction to the 
fractional Fourier transform and its applications. The 
details of the implementation of the discrete fractional 
Fourier transform on MATLAB are provided. Here we summarize applications of the fractional Fourier 
transform on noise removal of images. It transforms the 
representation of the data in the image and therefore allows 
us to perform novel techniques in this new domain. This 
allows us for effective noise removal problems that were 
difficult in the frequency domain.
